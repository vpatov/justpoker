Installing
    npm install

To build and run the server for development (watches for changes on save):
    nodemon

nodemon runs `npm run start_server`.
Server related commands have a `_server` prefix.

To start the react app, you can use the default npm command:
    npm run start

This runs `./scripts/start.js`
